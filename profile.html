					<h3>Past</h3>
					<p>I was born being male, obviously. Had passions and goals, some gone by the passing of time. But what have stayed with me from the past- are passions and goals that are still defining me. What I still have from the past, are loved ones and memories of those gone, dead or left. Amongst other things, including life lessons too. This is in short, what I still see worth sharing- as this case justifies.</p>

					<h3>Present</h3>
					<p>I am coding student who believes not only in commitment, character, faith, vision and passion paying off.  But rather also in the role Christ plays in the realness and essence of all these in me.
Apart from love for coding, music and advancement are both from the past; still with me and I do see accompanying me to the grave. As for other aspects of life- social and all- time and circumstances allowing- will share in time.

					<h3>Future</h3>
					<p>As with most, if not all- I am facing the future with plans and visions. One fitting to share, fitting the moment- is being a well-off, legit and authorative, Fullstack Web-Developer.
More to share, as time unfolds, is possible if we be touch and having reasons to share.
